- 👋 Hi, I’m @Ducanus
- 👀 I’m interested in all sorts of wild things. But I'm pretty chill about most things.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning C++, but do we really ever stop learning C++?
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on currently Cataclysm DDA. But we'll see where I go.
- 📫 How to reach me: Throw a brick with a note my way.
